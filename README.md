## This coding quiz does the following
- tells the user about the quiz, with a start button to begin the quiz
- starts a timer at 60 seconds and presents the user with the first question
- after an answer is clicked, the next question will show up
- the result of the previous answer (correct or wrong) shows up below the answers for the current question
- if the answer is wrong, 15 seconds are subtracted from the timer
- when the timer reaches zero or all the questions have been answered, the quiz ends and the score (the time left) is displayed
- the user can enter their initials, which will take them to a high score page with a list of the high scores sorted by score in local storage
- from the high score page, the user can go back to take the quiz again and can also clear the high score list
